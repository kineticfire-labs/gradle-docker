# Gradle 9 and 10 compatibility settings
# Override parent settings - scenario-2 has plugin task compatibility issues

# IMPORTANT: Configuration cache disabled for scenario-2 due to plugin task serialization issues
# DockerPublishTask and DockerSaveTask capture Project and Task references that can't be serialized
# with configuration cache. This requires plugin code changes to fix:
# - Replace Project references with injected services 
# - Replace Task references with provider-based configuration
# - Fix file property serialization issues in SaveSpec
