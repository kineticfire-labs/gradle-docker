/**
 * dockerWorkflows Scenario 4: Multiple Pipelines
 *
 * This scenario demonstrates running multiple independent pipelines:
 * - Dev pipeline: build + test only
 * - Staging pipeline: build + test + 'staging' tag
 * - Production pipeline: build + test + 'prod' and 'release' tags
 *
 * The verification task runs all pipelines and validates each applies correct tags.
