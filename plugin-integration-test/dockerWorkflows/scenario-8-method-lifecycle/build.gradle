/**
 * dockerWorkflows Integration Test: Scenario 8 - Method Lifecycle
 *
 * This scenario demonstrates using dockerWorkflows with lifecycle=METHOD,
 * where containers are started and stopped for each test method.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Uses lifecycle = WorkflowLifecycle.METHOD in the pipeline's test step
 * - Containers start fresh before each test method
 * - Containers stop after each test method
 * - Test class uses @ComposeUp annotation for Spock method lifecycle
 * - Pipeline still orchestrates build → test → conditional tag operations
 *
 * Port allocation (per README conventions):
 * - Service: 9207 (workflow scenario 8)
