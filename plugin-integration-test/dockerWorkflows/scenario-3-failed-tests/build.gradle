/**
 * dockerWorkflows Scenario 3: Failed Tests
 *
 * This scenario verifies the failure path in dockerWorkflows pipelines.
 * When integration tests fail, the pipeline should:
 * - Fail the build
 * - NOT execute onTestSuccess (no additional tags applied)
 * - Still run cleanup (composeDown)
 *
 * The verification task runs the pipeline and validates all failure behaviors.
