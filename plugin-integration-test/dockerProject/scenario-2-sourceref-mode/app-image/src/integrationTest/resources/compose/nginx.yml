# Docker Compose for dockerProject scenario-2-sourceref-mode integration testing
# Port 9301 is allocated for dockerProject scenario 2 (per README conventions).
#
# This compose file uses the pulled Docker Hub image directly.
# In sourceRef mode, the dockerProject DSL:
# 1. Pulls nginx:1.27-alpine from docker.io/library/nginx:1.27-alpine (if pullIfMissing=true)
# 2. Applies additional tags (like 'latest', '1.27') to the source image
# 3. The compose file references the source tag since that's what's available

services:
  nginx:
    # Use the pulled image directly (sourceRef mode uses existing image)
    # The tag must match one of the tags configured in dockerProject.image.tags
    image: nginx:1.27-alpine
    ports:
      - "9301:80"
    # nginx:alpine doesn't have a built-in health check, so we use waitForRunning
    # in the dockerProject test block instead of waitForHealthy
