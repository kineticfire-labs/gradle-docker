/**
 * dockerProject Scenario 4: Method Lifecycle Mode
 *
 * This scenario demonstrates the dockerProject DSL with method lifecycle mode
 * where containers restart fresh for each test method.
 *
 * Key features tested:
 * - lifecycle.set('method') configuration
 * - @ComposeUp Spock annotation integration
 * - Container isolation per test method
 * - Fresh state verification between tests
