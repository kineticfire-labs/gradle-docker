# Gradle properties for integration tests

# IMPORTANT: Integration tests must be run with --no-configuration-cache flag
# due to known compatibility issues with Gradle 9 configuration cache and Docker build tasks
# 
# Run integration tests with: ./gradlew clean fullTest --no-configuration-cache
# 
# Issue: Docker build tasks access system resources during execution that trigger
# "invocation of 'Task.project' at execution time is unsupported with the configuration cache"
# 
# The gradle.properties setting org.gradle.configuration-cache=false does NOT work reliably
# for this type of issue - must use the command line flag.

# Standard Gradle optimizations (these work fine)
