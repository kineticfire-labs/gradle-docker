## Clean-up

Recommendations

1. Consider consolidating delegateStackManagement and lifecycle - they serve overlapping purposes. Options:
   - Make lifecycle = 'method' automatically set delegateStackManagement = true
   - Or replace both with a single enum property: containerManagement = SUITE | CLASS | METHOD
2. Enforce sequential execution for method lifecycle - don't just warn, actively prevent parallel forks
3. Leverage existing infrastructure - The analysis underestimates how much is already built. Focus changes on:
   - Adding lifecycle property to TestStepSpec
   - Setting system properties in TestStepExecutor
   - Validation logic
4. Reduce user configuration burden - If possible, auto-detect lifecycle from DSL and eliminate the need for @ComposeUp annotation when using workflows
5. Add integration test for the key scenario - Ensure the test demonstrates:
   - Two test methods
   - Fresh containers for each method
   - Conditional actions still work based on aggregate test results

## Documentation

- concise description
- marketing statements / value / benefits (succinct)
   - gradle controls image actions like build, tag (retag), save, and publish
   - test the actual image that will be delivered, deployed, and used!  don't just assume the image will work because the 
   app inside it was tested.  there's a lot that can cause issues with a docker image/container. 
      - strategic foundation with "test what you ship" philosophy
   - Strategic Positioning: "Gradle-native Docker testing solution" with performance and developer experience advantages 
   over generic alternatives.
  
### Overall

- opinionated with Docker image build and tests in a subproject peer to the one that builds the application to be put 
  into a Docker container.  separation of concerns.
- Java 21
- Gradle 9 (esp. build cache configuration compliant)

### docker stuff

- dir layout

- all-in-one: build (multi-tag), re-tag (multi), save (multi), publish (multi images, multi repos)
  - assume image already exists
     - locally
     - remote, and pull
     - then: re-tag, save, publish
  - invoke task to do all or to do one by name

- build image
   - copy files w/ some change on copy
   - show source folder
  - invoke task to do all or to do one by name

- 'publish' block takes a 'tags' block, which can re-tag the image to publish to the correct registry
```groovy
Publish Tags vs Build Tags

  Analysis: Yes, the publish tags block can re-tag images during publish. Here's how it works:

  - Line 58: tags.set(["scenario2-time-server:latest"]) - Creates local image with this tag
  - Line 66: tags(['localhost:5200/scenario2-time-server:latest']) - Re-tags for registry push

  Behavior: The DockerPublishTask takes the locally built image scenario2-time-server:latest and tags it as localhost:5200/scenario2-time-server:latest
```

### test (compose) stuff

- single vs. multi compose files (they have different syntax)
- composeDown will automatically use the yaml files used by composeUp, but can override with different files if desired
- lifecycle to optimize (isolation vs speed) tests: suite, class, method
- wait for container healthy/running

### Developer stuff

- build plugin: g clean build <version prop: todo>
   - goes to  ?
- run integration tests... lifecycle tests
- when i build plugin, where does it go (like a jar would go to build/libs/)?  do i need to publishToMavenLocal?
- for running the integration tests, must the plugin have been published to maven local?
- takes about 8 to 12 minutes to run unit tests.  limit tests to what you changed, then run tests for all.
- takes about 28 minutes to run integration tests (not including tests with public registries).  limit tests to what you changed, then run tests for all.
   -  tests to public registries must be run separate

### Other

- don't change license section
