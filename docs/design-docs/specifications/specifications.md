# Specifications Document (SD)

This document provides specifications for implementation this project.

A Specifications Document (SD) details how requirements will be achieved, providing technical and 
implementation-specific information for developers.  Specifications documents describe the solution to the problem.

A Requirements Document (RD) is used to develop specifications documents.  A SD is used by  developers to implement the
software.

This SD is divided into three parts:
- [Function Specifications Document (SPD)](functional-specifications), which is formed from the sum of individual use 
cases at `./functional-specifications/`
- [Non-Functional Specifications Document (NFSD)](non-functional-specifications), which is formed from the sum of 
individual non-functional specifications at `./non-functional-specifications/`
- [Technical Specifications Document (TSD)](technical-specifications), which is formed from the sum of individual
technical specifications at `./technical-specifications/`

A functional specification in the SPD or a non-functional specification in the NFSD each lead to a technical 
specification in the TSD.
