# Task: Write Unit Tests for ComposeStackSpec Multi-File Properties

## Area: ComposeStackSpec Enhancement

## Type: Unit Test Implementation

## Description
Create comprehensive unit tests for the new multi-file properties and DSL methods in `ComposeStackSpec.groovy` with the goal of 100% coverage.

## Context
You are a Test Engineer and Principal Software Engineer expert at Java, Gradle, custom Gradle plugins, Groovy, Docker, and Docker Compose. You must ensure all unit tests pass and the build works with `./gradlew clean build`.

## Requirements

### 1. Create New Test File
Create `plugin/src/test/groovy/com/kineticfire/gradle/docker/spec/ComposeStackSpecTest.groovy`

### 2. Test Coverage Areas

#### Multi-File Properties Testing
- Test `composeFiles` ListProperty getter/setter functionality
- Test `composeFileCollection` ConfigurableFileCollection getter/setter functionality
- Test property initialization and default values
- Test null handling for properties

#### DSL Methods Testing
- Test `composeFiles(String... files)` with various inputs:
  - Single file
  - Multiple files
  - Empty array
  - Null inputs
- Test `composeFiles(List<String> files)` with various inputs:
  - Single file list
  - Multiple files list
  - Empty list
  - Null list
- Test `composeFiles(File... files)` with various inputs:
  - Single file
  - Multiple files
  - Empty array
  - Null inputs

#### Backward Compatibility Testing
- Test that existing `composeFile` property still works
- Test that both single-file and multi-file configurations can coexist
- Test precedence handling if both are set

#### Integration Testing
- Test interaction between different property types
- Test file ordering preservation
- Test conversion between file paths and File objects

#### Error Handling Testing
- Test invalid file paths
- Test non-existent files (if validation is implemented)
- Test malformed inputs

### 3. Test Structure
Use Spock framework following existing project patterns:
- Use `@TempDir` for file system testing
- Mock dependencies appropriately
- Follow existing test naming conventions
- Use descriptive test method names

### 4. Coverage Requirements
- Achieve 100% line coverage for new code
- Achieve 100% branch coverage for new code
- All tests must pass
- Build must succeed with `./gradlew clean build`

## Files to Create
- `plugin/src/test/groovy/com/kineticfire/gradle/docker/spec/ComposeStackSpecTest.groovy`

## Files to Reference
- `plugin/src/main/groovy/com/kineticfire/gradle/docker/spec/ComposeStackSpec.groovy`
- Existing test files in `plugin/src/test/` for patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
1. New test file is created with comprehensive test coverage
2. All new multi-file functionality is tested
3. Backward compatibility is verified through tests
4. 100% line and branch coverage is achieved for new code
5. All tests pass when running `./gradlew clean test`
6. Full build succeeds with `./gradlew clean build`
7. Tests follow existing project conventions and patterns
8. Error scenarios are properly tested

## Testing Patterns
Follow these patterns from existing tests:
- Use Spock Specification framework
- Use proper given/when/then structure
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Use meaningful test data
- Mock external dependencies

## Configuration Cache Guidance
Apply configuration cache principles in tests:
- Test that properties work correctly with Provider API
- Verify no `.get()` calls during configuration in tested code
- Test serialization compatibility where applicable

## Status

**Status**: done
**Date**: 2025-09-08
**Description**: Successfully implemented comprehensive unit tests for ComposeStackSpec multi-file properties. Added 43 new test methods covering all DSL methods (composeFiles with String[], List<String>, and File[] parameters), multi-file properties (composeFiles ListProperty and composeFileCollection ConfigurableFileCollection), backward compatibility, error handling, and Provider API integration. Achieved 100% line and branch coverage for the ComposeStackSpec class. All tests pass and the build succeeds with `./gradlew clean build`. No residual gaps or concerns - all acceptance criteria have been met.
