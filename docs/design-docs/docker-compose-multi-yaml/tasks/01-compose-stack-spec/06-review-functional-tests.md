# Task: Review ComposeStackSpec Functional Tests

## Area: ComposeStackSpec Enhancement

## Type: Functional Test Review

## Description
Review the functional tests for ComposeStackSpec multi-file properties, considering TestKit compatibility issues and configuration cache guidance.

## Context
You are a Test Review Engineer and Principal Software Engineer expert at Java, Gradle, custom Gradle plugins, Groovy, Docker, and Docker Compose. Be aware of guidance from `@docs/design-docs/gradle-9-configuration-cache-guidance.md` and `@docs/design-docs/functional-test-testkit-gradle-issue.md`.

## Requirements

### Review Checklist

#### 1. TestKit Compatibility Review
- [ ] Assess if tests use `withPluginClasspath()` method
- [ ] Check if tests encounter `InvalidPluginMetadataException`
- [ ] Verify if tests need to be disabled per TestKit compatibility issues
- [ ] Review documentation if tests are disabled

#### 2. Configuration Cache Compliance
Based on `@docs/design-docs/gradle-9-configuration-cache-guidance.md`:
- [ ] Tested code uses Provider API correctly
- [ ] No `.get()` calls on providers during configuration in tested code
- [ ] DSL implementations are configuration cache compatible
- [ ] Tested configurations work with `--configuration-cache` flag

#### 3. Functional Test Coverage (If Tests Are Active)
- [ ] Multi-file DSL configurations are tested (`composeFiles(...)` methods)
- [ ] Plugin integration with multi-file stacks is verified
- [ ] Backward compatibility with single-file configurations is tested
- [ ] Task generation works correctly with multi-file configurations
- [ ] Error scenarios and validation are tested

#### 4. Test Implementation Quality (If Tests Are Active)
- [ ] Tests follow existing functional test patterns
- [ ] TestKit setup is correct
- [ ] Build scripts in tests are valid
- [ ] Assertions are meaningful and complete
- [ ] Tests are isolated and repeatable

#### 5. Documentation Quality (If Tests Are Disabled)
- [ ] Clear explanation of why tests are disabled
- [ ] Reference to TestKit compatibility issue document
- [ ] Description of what functionality would be tested
- [ ] Plan for re-enabling tests when TestKit is fixed

#### 6. Build Integration
- [ ] Functional tests pass (or are properly disabled)
- [ ] Build succeeds with `./gradlew clean functionalTest`
- [ ] No impact on overall build process

## TestKit Issue Context
From `@docs/design-docs/functional-test-testkit-gradle-issue.md`:
- Gradle 9.0.0 TestKit has breaking changes with `withPluginClasspath()`
- 18/20 functional tests are currently disabled
- `InvalidPluginMetadataException` when loading plugin metadata
- Tests may need temporary disabling with documentation

## Configuration Cache Context
From `@docs/design-docs/gradle-9-configuration-cache-guidance.md`:
- Use `Provider<T>` and `Property<T>` for all dynamic values
- Never call `.get()` on providers during configuration
- Test with `--configuration-cache` flag enabled
- Avoid task.project access in execution blocks

## Action Required
Choose appropriate action based on TestKit compatibility:

### If TestKit Works:
1. Review test implementation quality
2. Verify comprehensive coverage
3. Ensure tests pass consistently
4. Check configuration cache compatibility

### If TestKit Issues Persist:
1. Review documentation quality
2. Verify proper test disabling with clear explanations
3. Ensure build succeeds without test failures
4. Confirm future re-enabling plan is documented

## Files to Review
- `plugin/src/functionalTest/groovy/com/kineticfire/gradle/docker/` (test files)
- Build output from `./gradlew clean functionalTest`

## Commands to Run
```bash
cd plugin
./gradlew clean functionalTest
./gradlew clean build
# If tests are active, also test configuration cache compatibility:
./gradlew clean functionalTest --configuration-cache
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### If Tests Are Active:
1. All functional tests pass consistently
2. Tests provide comprehensive coverage of multi-file functionality
3. Configuration cache compatibility is verified
4. Tests follow project conventions and quality standards
5. Build succeeds with functional tests enabled

### If Tests Are Disabled:
1. Tests are properly documented as disabled with clear reasons
2. Functionality that would be tested is clearly described
3. References to compatibility issues are included
4. Build succeeds with disabled tests
5. Re-enabling plan is documented

## Success Criteria
Either working functional tests or properly documented disabled tests that don't prevent the project from building successfully while maintaining clear documentation of the multi-file functionality that needs testing.
