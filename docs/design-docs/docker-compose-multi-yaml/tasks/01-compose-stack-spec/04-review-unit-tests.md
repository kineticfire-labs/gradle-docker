# Task: Review ComposeStackSpec Unit Tests

## Area: ComposeStackSpec Enhancement

## Type: Unit Test Review

## Description
Review the unit tests for ComposeStackSpec multi-file properties to ensure they pass, provide adequate coverage, and follow best practices.

## Context
You are a Test Review Engineer and Principal Software Engineer expert at Java, Gradle, custom Gradle plugins, Groovy, Docker, and Docker Compose. You must ensure unit tests pass and build works with `./gradlew clean build`, aiming for 100% coverage.

## Requirements

### Review Checklist

#### 1. Test Coverage Analysis
- [ ] Run `./gradlew clean test jacocoTestReport` to check coverage
- [ ] Verify 100% line coverage for new ComposeStackSpec code
- [ ] Verify 100% branch coverage for new ComposeStackSpec code
- [ ] Check coverage report at `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`

#### 2. Test Quality Review
- [ ] All tests follow Spock framework conventions
- [ ] Tests use proper given/when/then structure
- [ ] Test method names are descriptive and follow conventions
- [ ] Tests cover all new multi-file functionality
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios are tested
- [ ] Tests are isolated and don't depend on external state

#### 3. Functionality Testing
- [ ] `composeFiles` ListProperty is thoroughly tested
- [ ] `composeFileCollection` ConfigurableFileCollection is thoroughly tested
- [ ] All DSL methods (`composeFiles(String...)`, `composeFiles(List<String>)`, `composeFiles(File...)`) are tested
- [ ] Backward compatibility with single-file `composeFile` property is verified
- [ ] File ordering preservation is tested
- [ ] Null and empty input handling is tested

#### 4. Test Execution
- [ ] All tests pass when running `./gradlew clean test`
- [ ] No flaky or intermittent test failures
- [ ] Tests run in reasonable time
- [ ] Build succeeds with `./gradlew clean build`

#### 5. Code Quality in Tests
- [ ] Tests are readable and maintainable
- [ ] Appropriate use of `@TempDir` for file system testing
- [ ] Proper mocking where needed
- [ ] No code duplication in tests
- [ ] Test data is meaningful and realistic

#### 6. Integration with Existing Tests
- [ ] New tests don't break existing test suite
- [ ] Tests follow existing project patterns
- [ ] Consistent naming and structure with other spec tests

## Action Required
If tests don't meet requirements:
1. Fix failing tests
2. Add missing test cases to improve coverage
3. Refactor tests for better quality and readability
4. Ensure all tests pass and build succeeds
5. Update test documentation if needed

## Files to Review
- `plugin/src/test/groovy/com/kineticfire/gradle/docker/spec/ComposeStackSpecTest.groovy`
- Coverage reports in `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/`

## Commands to Run
```bash
cd plugin
./gradlew clean test jacocoTestReport
./gradlew clean build
```

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All unit tests pass consistently
2. 100% line and branch coverage achieved for new ComposeStackSpec code
3. Tests cover all multi-file functionality comprehensively
4. Backward compatibility is verified through tests
5. Build succeeds with `./gradlew clean build`
6. Tests follow project conventions and best practices
7. No test quality issues identified
8. Coverage gaps are documented if any exist

## Coverage Requirements
Based on project standards:
- 100% line coverage for new code
- 100% branch coverage for new code
- Any coverage gaps must be documented in `docs/design-docs/testing/unit-test-gaps.md`
- Tests must be isolated and not depend on network, filesystem, or clock

## Testing Standards
Follow project testing standards:
- Use property-based testing where applicable
- Test boundary conditions and edge cases
- Ensure tests are deterministic and repeatable
- Use meaningful assertions with clear error messages

## Status

**Status**: `done`  
**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Summary**: ComposeStackSpec unit test review completed successfully. All tests pass with 100% coverage for the spec package. Tests comprehensively cover multi-file functionality, DSL methods, backward compatibility, and error handling. No gaps or issues identified.

### Review Results:
✅ **Coverage**: 100% line and branch coverage achieved  
✅ **Test Quality**: High-quality Spock tests with proper given/when/then structure  
✅ **Multi-file Functionality**: All new `composeFiles` properties and DSL methods fully tested  
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Verified existing `composeFile` property works independently  
✅ **Build Status**: Clean build passes with `./gradlew clean build`  
✅ **Standards Compliance**: Tests follow project conventions and best practices

### Key Coverage Areas:
- Constructor and basic property testing (lines 36-145)
- Multi-file properties: `composeFiles` ListProperty and `composeFileCollection` ConfigurableFileCollection (lines 293-346)
- DSL methods: `composeFiles(String...)`, `composeFiles(List<String>)`, `composeFiles(File...)` (lines 348-464)
- Backward compatibility with single-file `composeFile` property (lines 466-510)
- Error handling for null/empty inputs (lines 330-346, 566-594)
- File ordering preservation (lines 530-544)
- Integration testing between different property types (lines 514-528)

**No residual gaps, concerns, or recommendations** - the test suite is comprehensive and meets all requirements.
