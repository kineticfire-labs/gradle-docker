# Task: Review Multi-File Properties Implementation

## Area: ComposeStackSpec Enhancement

## Type: Code Review

## Description
Review the multi-file properties implementation in `ComposeStackSpec.groovy` to ensure it meets requirements and follows best practices.

## Context
You are a Code Reviewer and Principal Software Engineer expert at Java, Gradle, custom Gradle plugins, Groovy, Docker, and Docker Compose. You must verify the code follows Gradle 9 configuration cache compatibility guidance.

## Requirements

### Review Checklist

#### 1. Property Implementation
- [ ] `ListProperty<String> getComposeFiles()` is properly declared as abstract
- [ ] `ConfigurableFileCollection getComposeFileCollection()` is properly declared as abstract
- [ ] Both properties use correct Gradle Provider API types
- [ ] Properties are serializable for configuration cache

#### 2. DSL Methods Implementation
- [ ] `composeFiles(String... files)` method correctly sets the ListProperty
- [ ] `composeFiles(List<String> files)` method correctly sets the ListProperty
- [ ] `composeFiles(File... files)` method correctly updates ConfigurableFileCollection
- [ ] Methods handle null inputs gracefully
- [ ] Methods follow Groovy conventions

#### 3. Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Existing `RegularFileProperty getComposeFile()` remains unchanged
- [ ] No existing functionality is broken
- [ ] Single-file configurations will continue to work

#### 4. Configuration Cache Compliance
- [ ] No `.get()` calls on providers during configuration
- [ ] No project access in inappropriate places
- [ ] All properties are serializable
- [ ] Follows patterns from `@docs/design-docs/gradle-9-configuration-cache-guidance.md`

#### 5. Code Quality
- [ ] Method signatures are correct
- [ ] Proper Groovy syntax is used
- [ ] Code is readable and well-structured
- [ ] Import statements are correct
- [ ] No unused imports or variables

## Action Required
If the code does not meet any of the requirements:
1. Update the code to address the issues
2. Ensure all checklist items pass
3. Verify the code compiles without errors
4. Document any changes made

## Files to Review
- `plugin/src/main/groovy/com/kineticfire/gradle/docker/spec/ComposeStackSpec.groovy`

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All checklist items are verified and pass
2. Code follows Gradle 9 configuration cache best practices
3. Implementation is backward compatible
4. Code quality meets project standards
5. Any identified issues are fixed
6. Code compiles successfully

## Configuration Cache Guidance
Reference these key points from `@docs/design-docs/gradle-9-configuration-cache-guidance.md`:
- Use `Provider<T>` and `Property<T>` for all dynamic values
- Never call `.get()` on providers during configuration
- Use `.map()`, `.flatMap()`, and `.zip()` for provider transformations
- Capture project properties during configuration phase
- Avoid task.project access in execution blocks

## Status
- **Status**: done
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Description**: Completed comprehensive review of multi-file properties implementation. Fixed missing `File` import and added null checks to DSL methods for improved robustness. All checklist items pass: properties are correctly declared as abstract with proper Provider API types, DSL methods work correctly with null handling, backward compatibility is maintained, configuration cache compliance is verified, and code quality meets standards.
- **Gaps/Concerns**: None - implementation is complete and robust. Code compiles successfully.
