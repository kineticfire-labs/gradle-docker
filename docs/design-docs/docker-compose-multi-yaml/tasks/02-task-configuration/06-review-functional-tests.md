# Task: Review Task Configuration Functional Tests

## Area: Task Configuration Logic

## Type: Functional Test Review

## Description
Review functional tests for task configuration logic, considering TestKit compatibility issues and configuration cache guidance.

## Context
You are a Test Review Engineer and Principal Software Engineer expert at Java, Gradle, custom Gradle plugins, Groovy, Docker, and Docker Compose. Be aware of guidance from `@docs/design-docs/gradle-9-configuration-cache-guidance.md` and `@docs/design-docs/functional-test-testkit-gradle-issue.md`.

## Requirements

### Review Checklist

#### 1. TestKit Compatibility Assessment
Based on `@docs/design-docs/functional-test-testkit-gradle-issue.md`:
- [ ] Determine if tests use `withPluginClasspath()` method
- [ ] Check for `InvalidPluginMetadataException` errors
- [ ] Verify if tests need disabling due to TestKit issues
- [ ] Review documentation quality if tests are disabled

#### 2. Configuration Cache Compliance
Based on `@docs/design-docs/gradle-9-configuration-cache-guidance.md`:
- [ ] Verify tested code uses Provider API correctly
- [ ] Ensure no `.get()` calls during configuration in tested functionality
- [ ] Check that multi-file configurations are cache-compatible
- [ ] Test configuration cache compatibility if possible

#### 3. Functional Test Coverage (If Active)
- [ ] Plugin integration with multi-file stacks is tested
- [ ] DSL parsing for various multi-file syntaxes is verified
- [ ] Task generation and configuration is tested
- [ ] Backward compatibility with single-file configurations is verified
- [ ] Validation and error scenarios are functionally tested

#### 4. Test Implementation Quality (If Active)
- [ ] Tests follow existing functional test patterns
- [ ] Build scripts in tests are valid and realistic
- [ ] TestKit setup is correct and consistent
- [ ] Test scenarios are comprehensive and meaningful
- [ ] Assertions verify the correct behavior

#### 5. Documentation Quality (If Disabled)
- [ ] Clear explanation of why tests are disabled
- [ ] Reference to specific TestKit compatibility issues
- [ ] Detailed description of functionality that would be tested
- [ ] Plan for re-enabling tests when TestKit is fixed
- [ ] Examples of test scenarios that are blocked

#### 6. Build Integration
- [ ] Functional tests pass consistently (or are properly disabled)
- [ ] Build succeeds with `./gradlew clean functionalTest`
- [ ] No negative impact on overall build process
- [ ] Test execution time is reasonable

## TestKit Issue Context
Current situation from `@docs/design-docs/functional-test-testkit-gradle-issue.md`:
- 18/20 functional tests are disabled due to Gradle 9.0.0 TestKit issues
- `withPluginClasspath()` causes `InvalidPluginMetadataException`
- Known compatibility issue affecting plugin testing
- Temporary disabling with documentation is the current approach

## Configuration Cache Context
Requirements from `@docs/design-docs/gradle-9-configuration-cache-guidance.md`:
- Task configuration must use Provider API correctly
- No provider resolution during configuration phase
- Configuration must be serializable and cache-safe
- Test with `--configuration-cache` if functional tests are active

## Review Actions

### If Tests Are Active:
1. **Verify Test Quality**
   - Review test implementation for completeness
   - Check that all multi-file scenarios are covered
   - Ensure error handling is tested
   - Verify integration scenarios work correctly

2. **Check Configuration Cache Compatibility**
   - Test with `--configuration-cache` flag if possible
   - Verify Provider API usage in tested code
   - Ensure serialization works correctly

3. **Validate Test Reliability**
   - Ensure tests pass consistently
   - Check for any flaky behavior
   - Verify build time impact is acceptable

### If Tests Are Disabled:
1. **Review Documentation Quality**
   - Ensure explanations are clear and complete
   - Verify references to compatibility issues are accurate
   - Check that test scenarios are well-documented
   - Confirm re-enabling strategy is documented

2. **Verify Build Success**
   - Ensure disabled tests don't cause build failures
   - Check that commenting/disabling is done correctly
   - Verify build succeeds with `./gradlew clean functionalTest`

## Files to Review
- `plugin/src/functionalTest/groovy/com/kineticfire/gradle/docker/` (test files)
- Build output from functional test execution
- Any documentation related to disabled tests

## Commands to Execute
```bash
cd plugin
./gradlew clean functionalTest
./gradlew clean build

# If tests are active and TestKit allows:
./gradlew clean functionalTest --configuration-cache
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### If Tests Are Active:
1. All functional tests pass consistently
2. Tests provide comprehensive coverage of multi-file task configuration
3. Configuration cache compatibility is verified
4. Tests follow project conventions and quality standards
5. Build succeeds with functional tests enabled
6. Test scenarios are realistic and meaningful

### If Tests Are Disabled:
1. Tests are properly documented as disabled with clear reasons
2. Functionality that would be tested is clearly described
3. References to TestKit compatibility issues are accurate
4. Build succeeds with disabled tests
5. Re-enabling plan is documented and realistic

## Success Criteria
The functional test review is complete when:
- Test status (active/disabled) is appropriate for current TestKit compatibility
- If active, tests provide good coverage and pass reliably
- If disabled, documentation clearly explains what needs testing
- Build succeeds regardless of test status
- Configuration cache compliance is verified for tested functionality
