# Task: Review Multi-File Docker Compose Integration Tests

## Area: Integration Tests

## Type: Integration Test Review

## Description
Review the integration tests for multi-file Docker Compose functionality to ensure they cover all scenarios, pass consistently, and meet quality standards.

## Context
You are a Principal Software Engineer and Test Review Engineer expert at Java, Gradle, custom Gradle plugins, Groovy, Docker, and Docker Compose. Reference `@docs/design-docs/gradle-9-configuration-cache-guidance.md` for configuration cache compliance.

#### 6. Test Reliability and Maintenance

##### Stability
- [ ] Tests are deterministic and repeatable
- [ ] No race conditions or timing issues
- [ ] Tests handle Docker environment variations
- [ ] Proper isolation between test methods
- [ ] Tests recover gracefully from failures

##### Maintainability
- [ ] Tests are easy to understand and modify
- [ ] Test code follows project conventions
- [ ] Resource files are well-organized
- [ ] Test documentation is clear
- [ ] Debugging information is adequate

## Action Required
If tests don't meet requirements:
1. **Fix Test Reliability**: Address any flaky or failing tests
2. **Improve Coverage**: Add missing test scenarios
3. **Enhance Quality**: Improve test implementation and assertions
4. **Update Resources**: Fix or improve test compose files
5. **Optimize Performance**: Reduce test execution time if needed
6. **Improve Documentation**: Add missing test documentation

## Files to Review
- `plugin-integration-test/app-image/src/integrationTest/java/com/kineticfire/gradle/docker/integration/appimage/MultiFileComposeIntegrationIT.java`
- Compose files in `plugin-integration-test/app-image/src/integrationTest/resources/compose/multi-file/`
- Build configuration and test setup files
- Integration test execution logs and outputs

## Commands to Execute
```bash
cd plugin-integration-test

# Run all integration tests
./gradlew clean fullTest

# Run only integration tests  
./gradlew integrationTest

# Run specific test class
./gradlew integrationTest --tests "MultiFileComposeIntegrationIT"

# Test with configuration cache if applicable
./gradlew clean fullTest --configuration-cache
```

## Docker Environment Verification
Ensure tests work correctly with:
- [ ] Docker Desktop on various platforms
- [ ] Docker Engine with Docker Compose plugin
- [ ] Legacy docker-compose CLI
- [ ] Various Docker Compose file format versions
- [ ] Different Docker image availability scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Test Success**: All integration tests pass consistently
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All multi-file compose functionality is tested
3. **Quality Standards**: Tests meet project quality and reliability standards
4. **Docker Integration**: Tests work correctly with actual Docker environment
5. **Build Integration**: Tests integrate seamlessly with build process
6. **Performance**: Tests complete in acceptable time
7. **Reliability**: Tests are stable and not flaky
8. **Maintainability**: Tests are well-structured and maintainable
