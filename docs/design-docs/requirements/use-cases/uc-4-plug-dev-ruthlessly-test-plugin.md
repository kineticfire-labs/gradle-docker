## Definition

**Actor**: Plugin Developer

**Goal**: Ensure the plugin is reliable, secure, and robust through comprehensive testing across all 
functionality levels, environments, and edge cases, particularly Docker-specific scenarios

**Preconditions**: Plugin source code available, development environment with Docker daemon, various test 
environments accessible (different OS, Docker versions)

**Post conditions**: Plugin demonstrated to be robust with high confidence in reliability across supported 
environments, with quantified test coverage and automated quality assurance

**Steps by Actor to achieve goal**:
1. Plugin Developer implements comprehensive unit tests for all plugin components with >90% line coverage
1. Plugin Developer creates functional tests using Gradle TestKit to verify plugin behavior in isolated projects
1. Plugin Developer develops integration tests with real Docker containers and Docker Compose environments
1. Plugin Developer performs end-to-end testing across different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL2)
1. Plugin Developer validates compatibility across supported version matrix (Java 21+, Gradle 9.0.0+, Docker versions)
1. Plugin Developer implements property-based and fuzz testing for configuration validation
1. Plugin Developer establishes continuous testing in CI/CD with automated quality gates
1. Plugin Developer performs security testing for registry authentication and credential handling
1. Plugin Developer validates plugin behavior under failure conditions (Docker daemon down, network issues, registry unavailable)
1. Plugin Developer documents test strategy and maintains test suite as plugin evolves

## Testing Strategy

**Testing Pyramid**:
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Fast, isolated tests for individual components, utility functions, and configuration parsing
- **Functional Tests (20%)**: Medium-speed tests using Gradle TestKit with temporary project setups
- **Integration Tests (8%)**: Slower tests with real Docker daemon, containers, and external services  
- **End-to-End Tests (2%)**: Full workflow tests across different environments and platforms

**Docker-Specific Testing Requirements**:
- **Real Docker Integration**: Tests with actual Docker daemon, image building, container lifecycle
- **Docker Compose Testing**: Multi-service orchestration with health checks and networking
- **Registry Integration**: Push/pull operations with authentication (mock and real registries)
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Linux containers on different host OS (Linux, macOS, Windows WSL2)
- **Version Compatibility**: Testing across Docker CE versions and Docker Compose v2 versions

**Quality Metrics and Gates**:
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 90% line coverage, 85% branch coverage
- **Static Analysis**: SpotBugs, Error Prone, and Gradle plugin best practices validation
- **Performance Testing**: Build time impact measurement, memory usage profiling
- **Security Testing**: Credential handling, registry authentication, input validation
- **Mutation Testing**: Verify test quality by introducing code mutations

**Test Environments and Matrix**:
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu LTS, macOS (latest), Windows with WSL2
- **Java Versions**: Java 21, 22, 23+ (latest LTS + current)
- **Gradle Versions**: 9.0.0 (minimum), current stable, current RC
- **Docker Versions**: Docker CE stable, previous stable, Docker Desktop variations

**Failure Scenario Testing**:
- Docker daemon unavailable or crashed
- Network connectivity issues during registry operations
- Insufficient disk space during image builds
- Permission denied scenarios
- Malformed Dockerfiles or docker-compose.yml files
- Registry authentication failures
- Container startup failures and timeout scenarios

**Continuous Testing Infrastructure**:
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated test execution on every commit and PR
- **Nightly Builds**: Full compatibility matrix testing across all supported versions
- **Performance Regression Detection**: Automated alerts for build time degradation
- **Test Result Reporting**: Clear feedback on test failures with actionable information

**Derived functional requirements**: fr-4

**Derived non-functional requirements**: nfr-12, nfr-13, nfr-14, nfr-15, nfr-16
