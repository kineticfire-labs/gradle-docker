## Definition

**Actor**: Project Developer

**Goal**: Utilize modern Gradle, Java, and tooling features in projects that consume the `gradle-docker` plugin 
while ensuring plugin compatibility across supported versions

**Preconditions**: Project environment with Java 21+, Gradle 9.0.0+, and `gradle-docker` plugin applied

**Post conditions**: Project successfully uses modern language/tool features while plugin provides reliable Docker 
functionality across supported version combinations

**Steps by Actor to achieve goal**:
1. Project Developer verifies project uses supported minimum versions (Java 21, Gradle 9.0.0)
1. Project Developer applies the `gradle-docker` plugin in their `build.gradle` file
1. Project Developer configures project to use modern Gradle features (Provider API, Configuration Cache)
1. Project Developer leverages contemporary Java features in application code (records, pattern matching)
1. Project Developer validates plugin functionality works with their modern tooling setup
1. Project Developer updates project when new plugin versions support additional modern features

## Consumer Compatibility Requirements

**Plugin Consumer Support**:
- Works with Java 21+ runtime environments
- Compatible with Gradle 9.0.0+ build environments  
- Supports projects using modern Gradle features (Configuration Cache, Provider API)
- Gracefully handles version compatibility issues with clear error messages

**Modern Feature Enablement**:
- Plugin tasks work correctly with Gradle's Configuration Cache enabled
- Plugin configuration uses Provider API for lazy evaluation
- Plugin supports projects built with modern Java toolchains
- Plugin documentation includes examples for modern Gradle/Java usage patterns

**Upgrade Path**:
- Clear migration guide for users upgrading from older Gradle/Java versions
- Version compatibility matrix published in documentation
- Deprecation warnings for unsupported version combinations
- Forward compatibility testing for reasonable future versions

**Derived functional requirements**: fr-5, fr-6, fr-7

**Derived non-functional requirements**: nfr-1, nfr-2, nfr-3, nfr-4, nfr-7, nfr-8
