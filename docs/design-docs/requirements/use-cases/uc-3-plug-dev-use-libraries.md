## Definition

**Actor**: Plugin Developer

**Goal**: Leverage well-maintained, Docker-focused libraries to accelerate plugin development while ensuring 
reliability, security, and maintainability of the `gradle-docker` plugin

**Preconditions**: Access to Maven Central and other trusted repositories, established library evaluation criteria

**Post conditions**: Plugin built using proven libraries for Docker interaction, testing, and utilities, resulting in 
more robust and maintainable code

**Steps by Actor to achieve goal**:
1. Plugin Developer evaluates Docker-related libraries against established criteria (maintenance, compatibility, security)
1. Plugin Developer selects appropriate libraries for core functionality (Docker API interaction, testing, utilities)
1. Plugin Developer integrates chosen libraries with proper dependency management and version constraints
1. Plugin Developer implements functionality using library APIs while maintaining plugin abstraction layers
1. Plugin Developer documents library dependencies and their purposes for future maintenance
1. Plugin Developer monitors library updates and security advisories for ongoing maintenance

## Library Categories and Examples

**Docker API Interaction**:
- Docker Java Client: Primary library for Docker daemon communication
- Docker Compose Java: For Docker Compose integration (if available)
- Consider: testcontainers-java for inspiration on Docker API patterns

**Testing Libraries**:
- Spock Framework: BDD-style testing framework for Groovy
- Testcontainers: For integration testing with real Docker containers
- WireMock: For mocking external Docker registry interactions
- JUnit 5: For Java-based unit and integration tests

**Utility Libraries**:
- Apache Commons: For common utilities (collections, strings, file operations)
- Jackson: For JSON parsing (Docker API responses, state files)
- SLF4J + Logback: For structured logging
- Gradle TestKit: For plugin functional testing

**Development Tools**:
- SpotBugs: Static analysis for bug detection
- JaCoCo: Code coverage measurement
- Error Prone: Additional compile-time error detection

## Library Evaluation Criteria

**Essential Requirements**:
- Active maintenance (recent releases, issue response)
- Compatible with minimum supported versions (Java 21, Gradle 9.0.0)
- Strong security record (no known vulnerabilities)
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

**Preferred Characteristics**:
- Minimal transitive dependencies to avoid conflicts
- Good test coverage and reliability track record
- API stability and backward compatibility commitment
- Performance characteristics suitable for build tool usage

**Integration Guidelines**:
- Use Gradle's dependency management features (version catalogs, constraints)
- Isolate library dependencies through abstraction layers
- Prefer compile-time over runtime dependencies where possible
- Document rationale for each major library choice

**Derived functional requirements**: fr-8, fr-9, fr-10, fr-32

**Derived non-functional requirements**: nfr-9, nfr-10, nfr-11, nfr-31
