# Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

A Functional Requirements Document (FRD) provides a detailed guide that specifies what a software or system must do by 
describing its features, functions, and user interactions. It acts as a blueprint, explaining the system's purpose and 
how users will interact with it, ensuring that the final product meets user needs and business goals.

| uc-6        | fr-1           | The plugin shall provide an `docker/images/image` configuration block that takes a string name to use as a convenient reference along with these additional enclosed configurations:<br/>- `context` which is a list 1 or more directories that should be included in the Docker build context (these are copied to a temporary directory); optional, defaults to `src/main/docker`<br/>- 'dockerfile' the name of the Dockerfile; optional, defaults to `Dockerfile`<br/>- `buildArgs` that defines one or more build arguments; optional<br/>- `tags` which is a list of 1 or more tags for the image (required); a `save` configuration block to save the image(s) to a file; optional | Draft  |
| uc-6        | fr-1           | The plugin shall provide a configuration block `docker/images/save` to configure one or more images to save.  The block shall accept<br/>- `compression` for the type of compression to use on the image, if any, consisting of `none` (no compression), `gzip`, `bzip2`, `xz`, `zip`, `zstd`; optional, defaults to `gzip`; `outputFile` which defines the file name of the output image (required)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Draft  |
| uc-6        | fr-1           | The plugin shall provide Gradle tasks to build the image(s), based on the `image` configuration blocks in `docker/images`:<br/>- `dockerBuildAll` builds all images<br/>- `dockerBuild<image name>` which is a task that builds one image based on the name given to the `image` configuration block.  The task depends on the 'clean' task.  The result of the task is that one or more images is created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Draft  |

Depends on the 'docker build` related tasks, if one is defined.  The result of the task is a new image(s) is tagged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Draft  |
