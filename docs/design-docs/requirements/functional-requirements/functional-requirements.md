# Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

A Functional Requirements Document (FRD) provides a detailed guide that specifies what a software or system must do by 
describing its features, functions, and user interactions. It acts as a blueprint, explaining the system's purpose and 
how users will interact with it, ensuring that the final product meets user needs and business goals.
