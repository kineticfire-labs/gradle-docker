# Requirements Document (RD)

This document provides requirements for implementation this project.

A Requirements Document (RD) outlines what a project or system needs to do, focusing on stakeholder needs and desired 
outcomes in a user-friendly, business-oriented language.  Requirements documents define the problem to be solved.

A RD is used to develop specifications documents.  A Specification Document (SD) is used by  developers to implement the 
software.

This RD is divided into three parts:
- [Use Case Document (UCD)](use-cases), which is formed from the sum of individual use cases at `./use-cases/`
- [Functional Requirements Document (FRD)](functional-requirements), which is formed from the sum of individual 
functional requirements at `./functional-requirements/`
- [Non-Functional Requirements Document (NFRD)](non-functional-requirements), which is formed from the sum of individual
non-functional requirements at `./non-functional-requirements/`

A use case in the UCD leads to the definition of functional requirements in the FRD and/or non-functional requirements 
in the NFRD.
