# Non-Functional Requirements Document (NFRD)

A Non-Functional Requirements Document (NFRD) outlines the quality attributes and constraints of a system, describing 
how the system should work rather than what it should do. These documents are critical for setting measurable goals for 
performance, security, usability, reliability, and maintainability, and they are essential for guiding development, 
ensuring user satisfaction, and achieving project success.
