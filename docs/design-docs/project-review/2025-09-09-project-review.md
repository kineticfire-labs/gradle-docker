## Executive Summary

Following comprehensive analysis of the gradle-docker plugin's Docker image testing approach, this plan outlines strategic enhancements to strengthen market position against Testcontainers while maximizing the plugin's unique Gradle-native advantages.

**Current State Assessment:**
- ✅ Strong strategic foundation with "test what you ship" philosophy
- ✅ Excellent lifecycle management (suite/class/method) design
- ✅ Elegant state discovery through JSON files
- ⚠️ Performance and resource management gaps
- ⚠️ Error handling and diagnostics weaknesses
- ⚠️ Competitive pressure from mature Testcontainers ecosystem

**Strategic Positioning:** "Gradle-native Docker testing solution" with performance and developer experience advantages over generic alternatives.

## Phase 1: Critical Foundation Improvements

### Step 1.1: Enhanced Error Handling & Diagnostics

**Objectives:**
- Eliminate silent failures that cause debugging frustration
- Provide actionable error messages for common container startup issues

  - HTTP endpoint validation with expected status codes
  - Log pattern matching for application readiness
  - Dependency chain validation (database → app → health)
- **Timeout Handling**: Graceful degradation vs hard failures
  - Progressive timeout warnings at 25%, 50%, 75% completion
  - Option to continue with partial stack for debugging
  - Clear indication of which specific services failed

**Value Justification:**
