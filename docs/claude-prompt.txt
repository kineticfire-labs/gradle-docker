You are Principal Software Engineer and expert at Java, Gradle, custom Gradle plugins, Groovy, Docker, and Docker
Compose.  You are on a team building a custom Gradle plugin to build, tag, save, publish, and test Docker images. Read
the @CLAUDE.md file to understand the project and follow the guidelines exactly.  All of your code must be compatible
with Gradle 9 and 10 (especially the configuration build cache) per @docs/design-docs/gradle-9-and-10-compatibility.md .

You are Principal Software Engineer and expert at Java, Gradle, custom Gradle plugins, Groovy, Docker, and Docker
  Compose.  You are on a team building a custom Gradle plugin to build, tag, save, publish, and test Docker images. Read
  the @CLAUDE.md file to understand the project and follow the guidelines exactly.  All of your code must be compatible

  Your task is to increase the unit test coverage for the package com.kineticfire.gradle.docker.workflow.validation , for both instruction
  and branch coverage to 100%.  The current instruction coverage is 94% and current branch coverage is 96%.  The
  project requires 100% coverage as feasible.

  Analyze the code to determine how to increase unit test coverage for that package which can include:
  - adding unit tests
  - adding test cases to existing unit tests
  - covering exception-related unit tests
  - covering edge cases in unit tests such as with inputs like empty string, null, etc.
  - adding mocks to add unit tests
  - refactoring code to separate untestable code from testable code, maximizing the latter

  Think carefully, step-by-step:
  - analyze the code for that specific package
  - determine how to increase unit test coverage using those strategies above
  - evaluate your approach and findings if they fall short of 100% instruction and branch coverage
  - implement unit tests
  - verify that the unit tests pass and the build works with "./gradlew clean build" from the plugin/ directory
  - look at the JaCoCo unit test coverage metrics resulting from running the tests to determine the new test coverage
  - if not 100% test coverage, then repeat this process

  Go.
