# Functional Testing Requirements

1. 100% functionality coverage is required.  
   a. All user-visible features, workflows, and expected behaviors must be tested.  
   b. All alternate and error cases must be tested.
2. Functional tests must validate end-to-end behavior, not internal implementation details.
3. If some functionality cannot be tested (e.g., due to technical limitations, Gradle 9 configuration cache 
   incompatibility, or dependency issues), then it must be documented in:  
   `docs/design-docs/testing/functional-test-gaps.md`  
   Include:
    - The functionality that is not fully tested
    - The extent of the gap
    - The reason why it cannot be tested
    - Recommendations for alternate test coverage (e.g., integration tests, manual validation)
4. Tests must run automatically and reliably in the CI/CD pipeline. Flaky or intermittent tests are not acceptable.
5. Tests must use production-like inputs, configurations, and environments wherever possible.
6. Each functional test must include clear success and failure criteria to verify correct behavior.
